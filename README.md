## 4. How to Use
The dashboard's header includes various filter controls that allow users to isolate data by specific criteria. You can filter results by party, gender, constituency (both Assembly and Parliamentary), age bracket, or a range of candidate assets. All visualizations and KPIs on the dashboard dynamically update as you apply these filters, providing a focused view of the data. The data also includes insights into NOTA votes and overall voter turnout, which can help in understanding broader voter sentiment.

## 5. Potential Insights & Analysis

* **Margin Analysis:** Examine the distribution of winning margins to identify closely contested seats versus landslide victories.
* **NOTA Impact:** Evaluate the absolute numbers and percentage share of NOTA votes to gauge its impact.
